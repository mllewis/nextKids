README

This file contains the merged and cleaned data from nextKids_pilot 1 and 2.

Manual edits:
- on run sheet: p045	3to4 -> 5to6
- on vocab survey: p037 "old" -> "middle"
- p029 next data has been removed from participant data file (necessary to remove manually in order to run embedding algorithm)
- added Clint's two subjects (202 and 203), age and gender data missing

This leaves us with the following subject counts:
23 23 10 (for summary: http://rpubs.com/mll/264953)
