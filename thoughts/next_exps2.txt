Food domain - cultural and so more variability
* novel?
* real? [get parents to talk about real? domain]

use next- random sample
get lots of data - get parents to do this at home?

[parents ]

* cultural variability (pairings) - real foods 

* novel fruit: word learning

3 proposals:
- descrkptive
- embeddings -> vocab
- vocab -> embeddings

* do adult version of experiment to look at coordination next fall

* presence of othe item teaching affecting new 

Q1: How does experience shaping semantic space?
- with parents
- age
- labels

- push it around with task demands/directions -> can they flexibly shift? [group level]
- have parents read different books + change conceptula space
- learning a new label -> reorganize space (novel labels)

dimensions of organization
certainty about clusters

learning a new word ~ semantic space

change over development (across kids)
related to parents/experience + vocabulary  (within kids)

different exemplars ()


PREDICTION: More discrete if you get labels/facts in a category learning task (categorical perception in kids with labels)

Show prototype - get label; biological fact or co-occurence fact or no fact
